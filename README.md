Hi, I'm Huw. A Data Scientist, Analyst and Strategist. Currently Data Scientist at [Appnovation](https://appnovation.com)

In my working life I help clients understand the power of data, how to utilise it and deliver analysis/infrastructure that enables data-driven strategy.

In my personal life I am a husband and father to one on the way. In my spare time I read a lot (mainly Theology and Science Fiction), learn about web/app development and contribute to Open Source (although I'm fairly new to it).
